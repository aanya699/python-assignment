#Write a Python program that:
#1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
#2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
#3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output

n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
def factorial(n):
    if n<2:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*(factorial(n-1))
r = factorial(n)
print(r)
