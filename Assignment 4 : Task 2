#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
#1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
#2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
#3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.

a=input("Enter text to write to the file: ")
print("Data successfully written to output.txt")
b=str(input("Enter additional text to append: "))
print("Data successfully appended.")

file1=open("output.txt", "w")
writingfile=file1.write(a+"\n ")
file1.close()

file1=open("output.txt", "a")
appending=file1.write(b)
file1.close()

file1=open("output.txt", "r")
reading=file1.read()
print("Final content of output.txt:\n", reading)
file1.close()
