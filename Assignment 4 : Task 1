#Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
#1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
#2.   Prints its content line by line.
#3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

try:
    file1=open("sample.txt", "r")
    reading=file1.read()
    print(reading)
    file1.close()

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: This file 'sample.txt' not found")
